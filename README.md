# My Website Prototype
in the process of developing a website for a fitness application I learned a lot about html, css, and java script. I ran into many issues along the way which helped me further develop my skills as a design programmer/coder

# Final Design

![final](../new%20one/img/reptrackss1.png)

although i completed a final design, i copy and pasted the html, css and javascript from one vscode project to this project because i experimented with my code on the other one.

I set up the server on this project but once I copy and pasted my code in the server did't display the code like how it displayed in the browser extension that I had in the other project and im not sure why

# The Process
while creating my fitness app prototype I went through several iterations and faced many challenges but ultimately I am happy that I made a functional application with javascript, html and css

I also faced challenges with my health which made completing the assignment quite diffucult. 

# The Future
Future iterations of my project could be adapted to include more pages for seperate features such as workour tutorials and a health page which tracks the workout progress over a series of days, weeks and months to show users their progess. Developers could use my github repository to adapt my current code and make it more functional. 

Frameworks could also be added to my prototype to adapt its aesthetic and funtionality.

# Conclusion

In conclusion I think I did okay on my project but Im pretty discouraged that the server didn't work how I wanted even though I tried to set it up perfectly.
